<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Tharun V, and I hail from Gorakhpur. I come from a Hindu family and I am a student of the fifth standard. Being in standard five, I am very well cared for and nurtured by my family. I study at KLE College Rajajinagar, Bangalore and I am the apple of the eye of my parents.</p>
